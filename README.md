# MERN-E-Commerce-Website

=>Overview:This MERN E-Commerce Website is a full-featured e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Redux for state management. The platform is designed to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface, coupled with a scalable backend that can efficiently manage e-commerce data. This project leverages the latest technologies to ensure flexibility and adaptability to future advancements in the e-commerce domain.

Features
